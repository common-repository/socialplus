== FAQ ==

= Is SocialPlus free? =

Yeah, of course! SocialPlus is totally free and open-source. If you really like, you can support the development of this plugin with a small donation.

= Does it work with JavaScript? =

Yes, you must enable JavaScript in your browser in order to use this plugin properly.

= Why aren't SocialPlus share buttons shown on homepage? =

If you have a static page as homepage, share buttons won't show on your homepage. If your share buttons aren't shown anyway on your homepage
consider that some WordPress themes do not output the post content on home page so they can't be shown.

= Where are Profile Buttons? =

Profile buttons are available on SocialPlus Widget. Configure your Profile Buttons from SocialPlus settings page and enable the SocialPlus widget on your website.
